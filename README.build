For Qt6 CMake is going to be the standard 3rd party build system.

CMake build was added in gama-q2 version 1.02. In the top
CMakeLists.txt you must set variable CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH (which is empty
by default), see two examples in the top CMakeLists.txt.

Old qmake project is still available for backward compatibility, but
it is not mantained and will be removed in future versions of gama-q2
project.
